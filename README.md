# Halloween: Let's dive into the history of Halloween event

## Inspiration 🎃

Halloween is an American holiday celebrated by children (and adults alike) every year. I wanted to create a website to delve deeper into the roots of Halloween and understand why it continues to be celebrated with such enthusiasm around the world. This project covers the origins of Halloween, how it has evolved over time, and the various traditions—such as costumes and trick-or-treating—that define it today. I was inspired to create a platform where visitors can learn the history behind Halloween and appreciate the holiday’s transformation from ancient times to modern festivities. I also added a photo gallery of iconic and successful costumes!

## How I Built It 🕸️

This website was built using HTML and CSS. HTML provided the structure, while CSS helped enhance the design with styles and animations. I carefully researched the historical context and origins of Halloween, integrating this information into engaging sections. The design and animations aim to create a visually captivating and immersive experience for users, echoing the mysterious and fun spirit of Halloween. Additionally, special attention was paid to visual aesthetics and functionality to make the content both informative and entertaining. I added some animations to enhance the user experience.

## Challenges I Faced 👻

One of the main challenges I faced was organizing my ideas in a way that was visually appealing and enjoyable for users. With so many interesting aspects of Halloween to cover, from history to costumes, I had to make sure the website was fluid and accessible to a wide audience. Balancing informative content with an attractive design took multiple iterations, but I am happy to have overcome these challenges, making the site both educational and enjoyable.

## Accomplishments That I'm Proud Of 🧟‍♂️

I am most proud of my accomplishments in the research phase, idea generation, design, and animations of the site. The research allowed me to create a knowledgeable resource, while the design and animations added a layer of excitement, drawing users into the Halloween experience. Creating a cohesive website that effectively conveys the story of Halloween while being visually appealing was a rewarding accomplishment.

## What I Learned 🧛‍♀️

Through this project, I improved my ability to create and organize a web page using HTML and CSS. Additionally, I gained a better understanding of how to use CSS animations to enhance the user experience, making content more dynamic and engaging. This project was obviously an opportunity for me to do some research to learn more about this holiday that many people take seriously!
